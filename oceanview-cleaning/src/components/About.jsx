                Summer of 2012 became the first “season” where cleaning experience began for Jenny. As years have gone by, she’s cleaned at a lot of prestigious condominiums along the panhandle. Jenny has developed a passion for cleaning, and spinning a personal touch on every spot she’s encountered.

                We at Oceanview Cleaning Co. desire to expand our services. In addition to condo cleaning services, we also offer move-in and move-out cleans for residential, deep cleans, short term rentals (i.e., Air BNB’s), campers/trailers, and everything in-between. Every job is approached with a can-do mentality and no job is too big nor too little.
